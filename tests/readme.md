Besides the standard tests found in the lib directory provided is an scss directory structure with imports that you can manually use to test out the functionality of the package.  

To use the scss test architecture open the tests folder as the root folder in a new sublime window.  The .deprc file is set to work correctly in this case.
Then open up the scss/site.scss file and from there you can drill down through a set of dependencies and back up through dependents to the site.scss parent file
